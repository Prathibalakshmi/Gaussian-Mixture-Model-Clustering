# Gaussian-Mixture-Model-Clustering
A Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. It attempts to find a mixture of multi-dimensional Gaussian probability distributions that best model any input dataset allowing the model to learn automatically, i.e. in an unsupervised manner. The bag-of-words model is a way of representing text data when modelling text with machine learning algorithms which can be combined with GMM to get a useful model representation.

Question:
Using a gaussian mixture model, perform a simple clustering on the given 2D Dataset. Try to find the optimal number of clusters using python (you may use any module to implement this). Now implement the same from scratch using python and a dummy dataset generated using scikit learn dataset generating functions such as make blob.

Steps:
- Importing the Libraries
- Loading the dataset
- Standadize the data
- Using Gaussian Mixture Model
- Plot BIC scores to find optimal number of clusters
- Based on the plot, you can visually determine the optimal number of clusters
- Fit GMM with the optimal number of clusters
- Predict clusters
- Visualize the results
